Okay, the user is finding SPARQL syntax difficult to read and remember, comparing it to SQL which they consider outdated. They want a modern syntax that's closer to natural English or Python's simplicity. Let me break down their needs.

First, I need to understand the main pain points. SPARQL's verbosity and structure might be the issues. They mentioned SQL's old concepts, so maybe the user is used to more modern, concise syntax like Python. They probably want something with less boilerplate, more intuitive keywords, and a structure that's easier to follow.

Next, the key SPARQL features to cover include SELECT, WHERE clauses with triple patterns, OPTIONAL, FILTER, UNION, aggregation, LIMIT, OFFSET, ORDER BY, subqueries, property paths, and federated queries. Any new syntax should handle these but in a cleaner way.

Looking at Pythonic examples, using indentation for blocks instead of braces makes sense. Replacing PREFIX with something shorter like @prefix could help. Using arrows like -> for relationships might make triple patterns more readable. For OPTIONAL, maybe a keyword like MAYBE would be more intuitive. FILTER could be a function-style condition. Aggregations could use methods like .agg() similar to pandas.

Also, handling variables with $ instead of ? might look cleaner. Grouping could use a GROUP BY clause with a HAVING condition. Federated queries might use a FROM REMOTE clause to indicate external sources. Property paths like / and | can replace SPARQL's syntax for sequences and alternates.

I need to ensure the proposal isn't just syntactic sugar but maintains the power of SPARQL. Maybe include examples comparing both syntaxes to show improvements. Also, mention that under the hood, it's still SPARQL to leverage existing infrastructure. Tools like transpilers could bridge the syntax gap.

Possible challenges: Ensuring the new syntax doesn't lose expressiveness, especially for complex queries. Also, making sure that the translation to SPARQL is accurate. Users might need to learn new keywords, but if they're more intuitive, the learning curve could be reduced.

Another consideration is tooling support. Highlighting that a transpiler could convert the new syntax to standard SPARQL would make adoption easier without changing existing backends. Also, integrating with Python could attract developers familiar with its ecosystem.

Finally, structure the proposal with examples side by side, explaining each feature. Keep the language simple and emphasize readability and familiarity. Mention optional features like reasoning and federation as extensions. Stress that the goal is to make SPARQL more accessible without sacrificing its capabilities.

Creating a more modern, human-readable syntax for SPARQL that aligns with Python-like simplicity or natural language is an exciting challenge! Below is a proposal for a reimagined SPARQL syntax that retains its core functionality while improving readability and usability. Iâ€™ll call this hypothetical language "SPARQL-Lite".

1. Simplified Prefixes
Replace verbose PREFIX declarations with a cleaner syntax inspired by Python imports:

python
Copy
prefix ex: <http://example.org/>
prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
2. Natural-Language Triple Patterns
Use arrow notation (->) for predicates and indentation for graph patterns:

python
Copy
select name, age where {
    ?person a ex:Person;
        -> ex:name ?name;
        -> ex:age ?age.
}
Comparison to SPARQL:

sparql
Copy
SELECT ?name ?age WHERE {
    ?person a ex:Person ;
        ex:name ?name ;
        ex:age ?age .
}
3. Simplified Variables
Use $ for variables (more familiar to Python users):

python
Copy
select $city where {
    $city -> ex:country "Germany";
        -> ex:population $pop.
    filter $pop > 1000000
}
4. Optional Patterns with maybe
Replace OPTIONAL with maybe for clarity:

python
Copy
select $name $email where {
    $person -> ex:name $name.
    maybe {
        $person -> ex:email $email.
    }
}
5. Filters as Python-like Conditions
Use Python-style comparison operators and functions:

python
Copy
filter $age >= 18 and "Berlin" in $city_names
6. Aggregations with Method Chaining
Adopt pandas-like syntax for aggregations:

python
Copy
select $country (avg($pop) as $avg_pop) where {
    $city -> ex:country $country;
        -> ex:population $pop.
}
group by $country
having $avg_pop > 1000000
order by $avg_pop desc
limit 10
7. Unions with either/or
Replace UNION with natural language:

python
Copy
select $name where {
    either {
        $person -> ex:job "Engineer".
    } or {
        $person -> ex:degree "Computer Science".
    }
}
8. Property Paths with / and |
Use operators for paths (similar to XPath or regex):

python
Copy
select $ancestor where {
    $me -> ex:parent+/ex:ancestor $ancestor.  # "+" for one-or-more
}
9. Subqueries with Indentation
Leverage Python-like indentation for subqueries:

python
Copy
select $company $avg_salary where {
    $company -> ex:employs $employee.
    $avg_salary = subquery {
        select (avg($salary) as $avg) where {
            $employee -> ex:salary $salary.
        }
    }
}
10. Federated Queries with from remote
Simplify federated query syntax:

python
Copy
select $scientist where {
    from remote <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
        $scientist a dbo:Scientist;
            -> dbo:discovery $discovery.
    }
}
11. Insert/Update/Delete with Verbs
Use imperative verbs for updates:

python
Copy
insert {
    ex:Alice -> ex:knows ex:Bob.
}

delete {
    ex:Alice -> ex:hates ex:Bob.
}
12. Built-in Functions as Python Methods
Use Python-like functions for common operations:

python
Copy
filter $name.starts_with("A") and $date.year() > 2000
Comparison to SPARQL
SPARQL-Lite	SPARQL
-> for predicates	ex:predicate
maybe	OPTIONAL
either/or	UNION
$variable	?variable
Python-like indentation	Braces {} and semicolons ;
Key Advantages
Readability: Less punctuation, natural-language keywords (maybe, either/or).

Familiarity: Leverages Python-like syntax and method chaining.

Expressiveness: Retains SPARQLâ€™s power (property paths, subqueries, federated queries).

Tooling-Friendly: Easy to parse and auto-format (like Pythonâ€™s PEP8).

Challenges
Backward Compatibility: Requires a transpiler to convert to standard SPARQL.

Semantic Ambiguity: Natural language keywords might introduce ambiguity.

Tooling: Requires new editors, linters, and engines.

Example Full Query
python
Copy
prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

select $scientist $discovery where {
    $scientist a dbo:Scientist;
        -> dbo:discovery $discovery;
        -> dbo:birthPlace $city.
    $city -> dbo:country "Germany".
    filter $discovery.year() > 1900
}
order by $discovery.year()
limit 5
This syntax could be implemented as a transpiler (like TypeScript to JavaScript) to run on existing SPARQL engines. The goal is to make semantic querying more accessible without sacrificing expressiveness. What do you think? ðŸ˜Š


Okay, the user is asking if we can remove special characters for variables and replace curly braces with indentation in a SPARQL-like syntax. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They found SPARQL's syntax hard to read and wanted something closer to Python. I proposed SPARQL-Lite with $ for variables and arrows for predicates. Now, they're pushing further: can we eliminate special variable symbols and use indentation instead of braces?

First, removing variable indicators. Variables in SPARQL use '?', which the user doesn't like. In SPARQL-Lite, I used '$'. But the user wants to remove any special characters. So maybe variables can be identified by context, like in Python where variables are just names. But SPARQL variables are in specific parts of the query, like after SELECT or in triple patterns. Maybe we can infer variables based on their position. For example, in a triple pattern, anything not a URI or literal could be a variable. But that might cause ambiguity, especially with prefixed names. For instance, ex:name could be a URI, but if 'name' isn't a prefix, is it a variable? That's a problem. So maybe we need a rule: variables are lowercase, and URIs are uppercase or use prefixes. But that's not foolproof. Alternatively, use a keyword like 'var' to declare variables, but that adds verbosity. Hmm.

Next, replacing curly braces with indentation. Python uses indentation to define blocks, so this is feasible. But in SPARQL, braces are used for graph patterns. So in the new syntax, indentation levels would define the scope. However, this requires careful handling, especially with nested patterns. For example, in a WHERE clause, each triple pattern's indentation would group them. But what about optional blocks or unions? They would need consistent indentation, which could be error-prone but aligns with Python's style.

Potential issues: Ambiguity in variable detection without special symbols. If a term isn't a URI or literal, it's a variable. But how does the parser distinguish between a typo in a prefix and a variable? For example, if someone writes 'ex:nam' instead of 'ex:name', it could be mistaken for a variable if 'nam' isn't defined. That's a problem. Maybe require that all variables are declared beforehand? That adds overhead but adds clarity. Alternatively, use a sigil for variables but make it optional in certain contexts. Wait, the user wants to remove any special characters, so sigils are out. So perhaps variables are just unquoted, non-reserved words that aren't URIs or literals. But that relies on the parser's ability to discern context, which can be tricky.

Another angle: look at how other languages handle this. In SQL, variables (if any) are often bound parameters with placeholders like ?, but in SPARQL, variables are part of the query structure. In Prolog, variables start with uppercase, but that's a different convention. Maybe in this new syntax, variables are any word that starts with a lowercase letter and isn't a reserved keyword or a prefix. But again, this could clash with existing terms.

Regarding indentation, replacing braces with indentation is possible but requires the parser to track indentation levels, much like Python. This would make the syntax cleaner but could lead to errors if indentation is inconsistent. However, modern editors handle indentation well, so it's manageable. The key is ensuring that the parser can unambiguously determine block structure based on whitespace.

So, to answer the user: Yes, it's possible, but with some trade-offs. Variables can be identified by context (no special characters), relying on the parser to distinguish them from URIs and literals. This requires clear rules, like variables being unquoted, lowercase words, while URIs use prefixes or are enclosed in angle brackets. Indentation can replace braces, using Python-like blocks. However, this approach may introduce some ambiguity, so careful design and parser rules are necessary to mitigate that.

Examples would help. Let's take a query where variables are just names, and blocks are indented. For instance:

select name, age where

person is a ex:Person

has ex:name name

has ex:age age

filter age > 30

Here, 'person', 'name', 'age' are variables. The 'has' keyword replaces the arrow. Indentation groups the triple patterns under the where clause. The parser would know that 'ex:Person', 'ex:name', 'ex:age' are URIs due to the prefix, and the rest are variables.

But what if a variable name clashes with a prefix? For example, if there's a prefix 'var' and a variable 'var:name'? That's a conflict. So perhaps variables cannot contain colons, and prefixes are strictly defined. Or enforce that variables are simple identifiers without colons.

In conclusion, removing special characters for variables and using indentation is feasible with careful syntax rules, though it may require stricter conventions and a smart parser to avoid ambiguity. Trade-offs between readability and unambiguity must be balanced.

Certainly! We can design a syntax that removes special characters for variables and replaces curly braces with Python-like indentation, leaning even further into natural language and simplicity. Letâ€™s refine the earlier proposal into "SPARQL-Lite v2", with these two goals in mind:

1. Eliminate Variable Sigils (e.g., ? or $)
Variables are inferred contextually: if a term is not a URI, literal, or keyword, itâ€™s a variable.
Example:

python
Copy
select name, age where
    person is a ex:Person
        has ex:name name
        has ex:age age
    filter age > 30
Here, person, name, and age are variables. URIs like ex:Person are explicitly prefixed, and literals like 30 are numeric.
No ambiguity: The parser treats unquoted, unprefixed terms as variables.

2. Replace Curly Braces with Indentation
Use Python-style indentation to define blocks (e.g., graph patterns, filters, subqueries).
Example:

python
Copy
select scientist discovery where
    scientist is a dbo:Scientist
        has dbo:discovery discovery
        has dbo:birthPlace city
    city has dbo:country "Germany"
    filter discovery.year > 1900
order by discovery.year
limit 5


Full Proposal
A. Triple Patterns as Sentences
Use has or is to mimic natural language:

python
Copy
city has ex:population 1000000       # Triple: (city, ex:population, 1000000)
city is ex:Capital                   # Triple: (city, a, ex:Capital)
B. Grouping with Indentation
Graph patterns are nested via indentation:

python
Copy
select person employer where
    person has ex:worksAt employer
        has ex:jobTitle "Engineer"
    employer has ex:industry "Tech"
C. Optional Patterns with maybe
python
Copy
select name email where
    person has ex:name name
    maybe:
        person has ex:email email
D. Unions with either/or
python
Copy
select name where
    either:
        person has ex:job "Engineer"
    or:
        person has ex:degree "Computer Science"
E. Property Paths
Use / for sequences and | for alternatives:

python
Copy
select ancestor where
    person has ex:parent+/ex:ancestor ancestor  # One-or-more path
F. Aggregations
python
Copy
select country (avg(population) as avg_pop where
    city has ex:country country
        has ex:population population
group by country
having avg_pop > 1000000
G. Subqueries
Indented blocks for subqueries:

python
Copy
select company avg_salary where
    company has ex:employee employee
    avg_salary = 
        select avg(salary) where
            employee has ex:salary salary
Ambiguity Mitigation
To avoid confusion between variables, URIs, and literals:

Prefixes are mandatory for URIs (e.g., ex:Person).

Literals are explicitly typed:

python
Copy
filter age > 30                   # Integer
filter name == "Alice"            # String
filter date == 2024-05-20         # Date
Reserved keywords (has, is, maybe, either, or, filter, etc.) cannot be variables.

Example Query Without Sigils or Braces
python
Copy
prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

select scientist discovery where
    scientist is dbo:Scientist
        has dbo:discovery discovery
        has dbo:birthPlace city
    city has dbo:country "Germany"
    filter discovery.year > 1900
order by discovery.year desc
limit 5
Advantages
Cleaner syntax: No ?, $, or {}.

Natural language flow: Reads like a structured English sentence.

Tooling-friendly: Auto-indentation in editors (like Python) reduces errors.

Okay, the user wants me to improve the handling of nested indents in the PyQL grammar and make the rules stricter. Let me start by recalling how the current code handles indentation. The previous grammar used regular expressions for Indent and Dedent, but that might not be sufficient for nested structures.

Parsimonious doesn't have built-in support for indentation-sensitive parsing like some other parsers (e.g., ANTLR), so I need a way to track indentation levels manually. Maybe I can use a stateful approach, where each indent increases the current level and each dedent decreases it. But how to integrate that into the PEG grammar?

Wait, the user mentioned using the Parsimonious library. Since it's a PEG parser, perhaps I can create a custom node visitor that tracks the indentation level during parsing. That way, each Indent node would check that the whitespace is exactly one level more than the current, and Dedent nodes would reduce the level.

In the previous code, Indent was matched with a regex for newline followed by spaces, and Dedent was a newline not followed by spaces. But that's not checking the actual indentation depth. So the main issue is ensuring that each nested block increases the indentation by a consistent amount (e.g., 4 spaces) and that dedents properly step back.

I need to modify the grammar to enforce consistent indentation levels. Let's assume 4 spaces per indent level. For each Indent, the whitespace must be exactly current_level + 4. Dedent would then be a reduction by 4.

But how to represent this in the grammar? Maybe capture the exact number of spaces and track the current level in the visitor. However, Parsimonious doesn't support stateful parsing out of the box. Hmm.

Alternatively, the grammar can capture the whitespace for each line and then, in the visitor, verify that the indentation is correct relative to the parent. For example, each block starts with an Indent (specific number of spaces) that is exactly 4 more than the parent's indentation.

So, the Indent rule would need to match the expected number of spaces based on the current indentation level. But since PEG grammars are context-free, this might not be straightforward. Maybe the solution is to track the indentation level outside the grammar, in the visitor, and raise errors if the indentation doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to process the indentations in the visitor by keeping a stack of indentation levels. For each line, when we encounter an indentation, we check if it's exactly one level deeper than the current. If not, raise a parse error.

But integrating this into the Parsimonious grammar might require modifying how the Indent and Dedent nodes are handled. The grammar can capture the whitespace, and then the visitor checks the indentation levels against the stack.

Let me sketch this out. The Indent rule would match a newline followed by some spaces. The Dedent rule would match a newline followed by fewer spaces than the current level. In the visitor, each time we process an Indent, we push the new level onto the stack. For Dedent, we pop the level.

But how to enforce that the indentation is exactly one level deeper each time? The grammar can't enforce this dynamically, so it's up to the visitor to validate the indentation levels. So, the grammar would capture the whitespace, and the visitor would check the actual spaces count against the expected level.

So, modifying the grammar to capture the exact number of spaces for each indent. Then, in the visitor, track the current indentation level. For each Indent node, check that the whitespace is 4 spaces more than the current level, update the level, and proceed. For Dedent, check that the next line's indentation is less than the current level and adjust accordingly.

But how to represent this in the existing grammar? Let's adjust the Indent and Dedent rules:

Indent = ~r'\n( {4})+'

Dedent = ~r'\n( {0,3}(?=\S)|(?=\S))'

But this might not capture the exact levels. Alternatively, capture the whitespace as a string and then compute the level in the visitor.

In the grammar:

Indent = ~r'\n( +)'

Then, in the visitor, for each Indent node, check that the captured whitespace length is equal to (current_level + 4). Similarly, Dedent would require that the next line's indentation is less than current_level.

This approach requires the visitor to track the current indentation level and validate each Indent and Dedent against it.

Modify the Transpiler class to include a stack for indentation levels. For example:

class PyQLTranspiler(NodeVisitor):

def __init__(self):

self.indent_stack = [0]  # Start with 0 indentation

def visit_Indent(self, node, children):

whitespace = node.text[1:]  # Skip the newline

current_level = self.indent_stack[-1]

expected_level = current_level + 4

if len(whitespace) != expected_level:

raise ParseError(f"Expected {expected_level} spaces, got {len(whitespace)}")

self.indent_stack.append(len(whitespace))

def visit_Dedent(self, node, children):

# Dedent is handled when a line has less indentation

# This might need to be checked in the parent node's processing

pass

But how to detect dedents? Maybe Dedent isn't a separate node, but when processing a new line, the indentation is checked against the current level. If it's less, we pop the stack until we find a matching level.

Alternatively, the Dedent is not a separate token, and the visitor must track when the indentation decreases. This complicates the visitor logic.

Another approach: Use a stateful lexer to track indentation. But since we're using Parsimonious, which is a parsing expression grammar (PEG) parser, not a lexical analyzer, this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, pre-process the input to convert indentation into INDENT and DEDENT tokens, similar to how Python's tokenizer works. Then, the grammar can include these tokens.

But integrating that into the existing setup would require a pre-processing step. Let me think.

The user wants to use Parsimonious, so the solution must fit within that framework. Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to modify the grammar to capture the exact indentation level for each line and then, in the visitor, check that each nested block increases the indentation by exactly 4 spaces.

So, the grammar would have rules to capture the indentation for each line. For example:

Line = Indentation? Content

But integrating this into the current grammar structure might be complex. Alternatively, structure the grammar such that each block starts with an increase in indentation.

Alternatively, represent each level of indentation as a separate rule. For example:

Block = Indent Pattern Dedent

Where Indent requires the indentation to be exactly 4 spaces more than the current level, and Dedent checks for a return to the previous level.

But this requires tracking the indentation level in the visitor.

So, revising the grammar:

Indent = ~r'\n( {4})+'

But this would match any multiple of 4 spaces. Wait, no. The regex ~r'\n( {4})+' would match a newline followed by one or more groups of 4 spaces. So, for example, \n    (4 spaces) is one level, \n        (8 spaces) is two levels, etc.

But we want each indent to be exactly one level (4 spaces) more than the previous. So, in the visitor, we can track the expected indentation level. For example, when entering a block, the indentation must be current_level + 4.

So, in the visitor:

- Start with current_level = 0.

- When processing an Indent node, check that the total whitespace is current_level + 4.

- Update current_level to the new value.

- When processing a Dedent, current_level is reduced by 4.

But how to capture Dedent in the grammar? Dedent occurs when a line has less indentation than the current level. Since PEG parsers are greedy, perhaps we need to structure the grammar to expect a certain indentation level at each block.

Alternatively, the Dedent is implicit when a line's indentation is less than the current level. However, this is challenging in a PEG grammar.

Perhaps the solution is to structure the grammar to expect specific indentation levels for nested blocks. For example:

Block = Newline Indent(4) Pattern Dedent(4)

But Parsimonious doesn't support parameterized rules. Therefore, this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative idea: Use a separate rule for each indentation level. But that's impractical.

Given the time constraints and the need for a practical solution within Parsimonious, perhaps the best approach is to enforce that each indent is exactly 4 spaces more than the previous, and in the visitor, track the current indentation level, raising errors if the indentation doesn't match.

So, modifying the Indent and Dedent rules to capture the whitespace, and in the visitor, check the length.

In the grammar:

Indent = ~r'\n( +)'  # Capture newline followed by spaces

Then, in the visitor's visit_Indent method:

def visit_Indent(self, node, children):

indent_spaces = len(node.text[1:])  # Exclude the newline

current_level = self.indent_stack[-1]

expected_level = current_level + 4

if indent_spaces != expected_level:

raise ParseError(f"Expected {expected_level} spaces, got {indent_spaces}")

self.indent_stack.append(indent_spaces)

Similarly, when a Dedent occurs (i.e., a line with fewer spaces), the visitor would need to check that the indentation level is properly reduced. However, detecting Dedent in the grammar is tricky. Instead, during the processing of each line, the visitor can track the current indentation level and verify that subsequent lines either maintain, increase, or decrease the level appropriately.

Wait, perhaps the Dedent is not a separate node but is handled when a line's indentation is less than the current level. So, in the visitor, when processing a new line, compare its indentation to the current level. If it's less, then dedent to the appropriate level.

This approach would require modifying the visitor to handle each line's indentation and manage the stack accordingly. However, integrating this into the existing grammar would require restructuring the rules to process each line's indentation.

Alternatively, the grammar can be structured so that each block is a series of lines with increasing indentation. For example:

Block = Indent Line+ Dedent

But again, without state, this is hard.

Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to adjust the existing grammar to capture the exact indentation and modify the visitor to enforce consistent nesting.

In the previous code, the Indent rule was ~r'\n\s+', which matches any whitespace after a newline. But to enforce 4-space indentation, change it to ~r'\n {4}'.

Wait, but that would only match exactly 4 spaces. However, nested blocks would need 8, 12, etc. But in the visitor, each Indent node would push 4 more spaces onto the stack.

Wait, perhaps the grammar can match exactly 4 spaces for each indent level, and the visitor tracks the expected level.

But how to represent multiple indent levels? For example:

Block:

line1

line2

subline1

subline2

In this case, 'subline1' is indented by 8 spaces, which is two levels. So each level is 4 spaces. So, the grammar can have a rule for each Indent step:

Indent = ~r'\n( {4})'

But this would only match 4 spaces. To allow multiple levels, the visitor would track the expected indentation. Each time an Indent is encountered, it must be exactly 4 more than the current level.

Wait, no. Each Indent token in the grammar is exactly 4 spaces. Then, nested blocks would have multiple Indent tokens. For example, a block with two levels of indentation would have two Indent nodes.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to have each indent level represented by a separate Indent node. For example:

Line1

Line2 (Indent 4)

Line3 (Indent 8)

But in the grammar, each Indent is 4 spaces, so multiple Indents would add up. However, in the grammar, it's difficult to represent this because the new line's indentation is matched as a single Indent node of 4 spaces. So, for two levels, the indentation would be 8 spaces, which would be two Indent nodes? Or one node with 8 spaces?

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to modify the Indent rule to capture the exact number of spaces and then, in the visitor, ensure that each indentation step is exactly 4 spaces more than the previous.

So, the grammar's Indent rule is:

Indent = ~r'\n( +)'

Then, in the visitor, when processing an Indent node:

def visit_Indent(self, node, children):

current_level = self.indent_stack[-1]

indent_spaces = len(node.text[1:])  # Length after newline

if indent_spaces != current_level + 4:

raise ParseError(...)

self.indent_stack.append(indent_spaces)

But how to handle dedents? For example, after a block, the next line has less indentation. The Dedent would be inferred when the indentation level decreases. However, in the grammar, each line's indentation is processed as part of the Indent node for that line.

So, during the processing of each line, the visitor checks the indentation level. If it's less than the current level, it dedents accordingly.

This would require the visitor to track the current indentation level and adjust it as each line is processed. But integrating this into the existing visitor structure might require significant changes.

Alternatively, restructure the grammar to process each line with its indentation and manage the stack in the visitor.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to modify the existing code to track the indentation level in the visitor and raise errors if the indentation is inconsistent.

So, revising the transpiler's visit_Indent method to check the indentation level.

In the previous code, the Indent rule was matched with ~r'\n\s+', which includes the newline and spaces. The visitor would then check the length of the spaces and ensure it's exactly 4 more than the current level.

Let me adjust the grammar and visitor accordingly.

First, update the Indent rule to capture the spaces:

Indent = ~r'\n( +)'

Then, in the visitor:

def visit_Indent(self, node, children):

whitespace = node.text[1:]  # After the newline

current_level = self.indent_stack[-1]

expected_level = current_level + 4

if len(whitespace) != expected_level:

raise ValueError(f"Invalid indentation: expected {expected_level} spaces, got {len(whitespace)}")

self.indent_stack.append(len(whitespace))

return ''

But wait, each Indent in the grammar corresponds to a newline and spaces. However, in nested blocks, each subsequent line would have more spaces. For example:

select scientist where

scientist has dbo:discovery discovery

has dbo:year year

Here, the third line is indented by 8 spaces. The first indent after 'where' is 4 spaces, then the next line is 8. The visitor should check that each indent is exactly 4 more than the previous.

But in the grammar, each line's indentation is captured as an Indent node. So, for the third line, the Indent node's whitespace is 8 spaces. The visitor would check that 8 is equal to the current level (4) + 4 â†’ 8, which is correct.

When the block ends, the dedent would occur when a line has less indentation. However, the grammar as written doesn't explicitly capture dedents. So, the visitor must track when the indentation decreases.

But how to detect dedents in the grammar? It's challenging because dedents aren't marked explicitly. Therefore, the visitor must handle this during processing.

For example, after processing a block, when the next line's indentation is less than the current level, the visitor must pop the stack until it matches.

But integrating this into the existing visitor requires that each line's indentation is checked against the current level. This suggests that the visitor needs to process each line's indentation, compare it to the current level, and adjust the stack accordingly.

This complicates the visitor logic, as the transpiler would need to manage the indentation stack for each line, not just for block structures.

Perhaps the solution is to restructure the grammar to handle each line's indentation explicitly and use the visitor to manage the stack.

However, given the complexity, maybe it's better to model the Dedent as a reduction in the indentation level. For example, after a block, when the next line's indentation is less than the current level, we generate a Dedent event.

But without modifying the grammar to recognize dedents, this is difficult. An alternative approach is to pre-process the input into tokens that include INDENT and DEDENT events based on the whitespace changes, similar to Python's tokenize module.

But integrating that with Parsimonious would require writing a custom tokenizer, which is beyond the current scope.

Given the time, perhaps the best way to proceed is to adjust the existing code to track the indentation level in the visitor and enforce that each nested block increases the indentation by exactly 4 spaces. Dedents are handled implicitly when the indentation level decreases, but the visitor would need to manage that.

So, in the transpiler's visit method for each line, check the indentation level, and adjust the stack as needed.

But how to associate each line with its indentation level in the grammar? Maybe the grammar should capture each line's indentation and content, then in the visitor, process them in order, checking the indentation level each time.

Restructuring the grammar to capture lines with their indentation:

Line = Indent? Content

But this is too simplistic. Alternatively, the Pattern rule could consist of multiple Line nodes, each with their own indentation.

But this requires significant changes to the existing grammar. For example:

Pattern = Line+

Line = Indent? TriplePattern

But this might not capture nested blocks properly.

Alternatively, each Block is defined by an increase in indentation. For example:

Block = Indent Pattern Dedent

But again, without state, it's hard to track.

Given the time constraints and the user's request to improve nested indent handling with stricter rules, the practical approach is to modify the existing code to track indentation levels in the visitor and enforce that each indent is exactly 4 spaces more than the current level, and dedents are handled by reducing the stack when the indentation decreases.

This involves:

1. Modifying the Indent rule to capture the whitespace.

2. In the visitor, checking that each indent is +4 spaces.

3. Managing a stack of indentation levels.

4. Raising errors on invalid indentation.

Implementing this would make the indentation handling stricter and ensure nested blocks are properly structured.

So, updating the grammar and visitor as follows:

Grammar:

Indent = ~r'\n( +)'

Visitor:

class PyQLTranspiler(NodeVisitor):

def __init__(self):

self.indent_stack = [0]  # initial indentation level

def visit_Indent(self, node, children):

whitespace = node.text[1:]  # after newline

current_level = self.indent_stack[-1]

if len(whitespace) != current_level + 4:

raise ValueError(f"Expected indentation of {current_level + 4} spaces, got {len(whitespace)}")

self.indent_stack.append(len(whitespace))

return ''

def visit_Dedent(self, node, children):

# Dedent occurs implicitly when a line has less indentation

# This would need to be handled when processing subsequent lines

# Not directly captured in the grammar, so may need to track in the visitor

pass

But dedent handling remains a challenge. To detect dedents, the visitor would need to compare the current line's indentation with the stack. This would require processing each line's indentation in sequence and adjusting the stack as needed.

Perhaps modifying the visitor's visit_Pattern method to handle each line and manage the indentation stack.

For example:

def visit_Pattern(self, node, children):

lines = children

output = []

for line in lines:

# line includes indentation and content

# process indentation level

# compare with current level

# adjust stack and generate SPARQL

pass

return ' '.join(output)

But this would require each line to have its indentation processed before the content.

This approach complicates the visitor's structure but allows for precise control over indentation levels.

In summary, the key steps are:

1. Modify the grammar to capture indentation spaces.

2. Track indentation levels in the visitor using a stack.

3. Enforce that each indent is +4 spaces.

4. Handle dedents by popping the stack when indentation decreases.

This will make nested indents stricter and improve the transpiler's accuracy.

Letâ€™s refine the PyQL grammar to enforce strict, consistent indentation (4 spaces per level) and improve nested block handling. Weâ€™ll use parsimonious with a stateful IndentStack helper to track indentation levels. Hereâ€™s the improved version:
